To move up, use a positive y value. To move down, use a negative value. To move left, use a negative x value. To move right, use a positive value.<br><br>To rotate your sprite, use <img src='./img/pointatblock.png'/>. It rotates to the angle that you give it. <br><br> To change the size of your sprite, you need to use <img src='./img/size.png'/>.

This avoids the need to scroll and allows more control over the flow of your code!<br><br>You create a function by first broadcasting a message, using <img src='./img/broadcast.png'/>. This will broadcast the name of a function to be executed. <br><br>You name a chunk of code as a function by using <img src='./img/receive.png'/>.

Birds make their nest in circles, for theirs is the same religion as ours. The sun comes forth and goes down again in a circle....

Note how that simulation script allows a nice visualization of how the circles expand, with one more translation/stamp in each radius. You can even introduce new colors this way as well. <div class='row justify-content-center'><div class='col-12'><a href='./img/circles.png' target='_blank'><img src='./img/circles.png' class='img-fluid' /></a></div></div>",
